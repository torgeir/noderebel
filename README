# Noderebel

Launching an app with "noderebel app.js" will copy all files from the current directory to a tmp dir and further on compare diffs with these files as changes to your files are made. If any changes are found, noderebel will restart your node.js app.

Noderebel is only tested on OS X, though I reckon the pid hack is the only one specific for OS X, as I did not happen to find a pidof command as found on other *nixes

# Usage

## Starting
chmod +x noderebel
noderebel my-node-js-app.js

## Stopping
ctrl+c
